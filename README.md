### Hi, I'm Ernst ðŸ‘‹

I graduated from [KTH](https://github.com/KTH) with a Computer Science degree in 2021. During 2021-2022 I worked on open source in the education sector at [SUNET](https://github.com/SUNET). 

My favorite languages are JavaScript, Go, and C. I like Vim and Neovim.

I generally work on both back end and front end. My main skill set is in coding, but I am also interested in UI design and enjoy making things look good.

My biggest project on GitHub is [days](https://github.com/ernstwi/days). At the time of writing the latest tagged version is 1.9.5, but I consider it to be in pre-release development. Later on I would like to get some more people using it and hopefully contributing to its further development. ðŸ™‚

I am currently looking for work in Stockholm, feel free to contact me via email.
